# TMMS-GUI : Transcriptomics, metabolomics multivatiate statistical analysis GUI

### Simple app for intergrating transcriptomics and metabolomics data

There are so far only a handfull of open source user friendly tools available for intergrating transcriptomics and metabolimic data set. It is hope that the easy to use TMMS-GUI will help this growing field.

The app itself is relatively self explainatory, but there are some simple rule (mainly common sence) that you so need to follow.

1. Please make sure sample naming convention is consistance across transcriptomics and metabolomics data set
2. Please make sure you have a unique identifier for your gene name and metabolomics name (You can use gene name and compound name directly, providing they are unique)
3. For both transcriptomics and metabolomics data set, please ensure sample names are in rows, genes and compound ID as columns. Example files can be downloaded together with the APP and example snapshots are listed below.
